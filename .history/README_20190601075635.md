# Kuzzle Kickoff Boilerplate

a Simple boilerplate to kick start a Kuzzle instance on Ubuntu 18.04

This kickstart will get a production server going through an interactive bash terminal;

Full Kuzzle stack;
  - All required utilities
  - Elasticsearch
  - Redis

Optionally can also install;
  - Generate SSL certificates
  - Reverse proxy
  - Setup domain name

## Prerequisite

- Running Ubuntu 18.04 installation locally or on a VM.
- Have a user with sudo privilege.

You can create a user with sudo privilege with these commands [ON THE SERVER]:

    sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "Kuzzle Server" -U kuzzle
    sudo usermod -aG sudo kuzzle
    sudo passwd kuzzle

## Installing Kuzzle

For a supposed successful installation follow these instructions.

From your local MacOSx or Linux machine;

This script copies the installation scripts and ssh login keys to server.

    git clone https://github.com/TitanKing/KuzzleKickoffBoilerplate.git
    cd KuzzleKickoffBoilerplate
    chmod -x first-upload.sh
    bash first-upload.sh

Now all your scripts are on the server and it will have logged your right in.

NOTE: If you are installing from a Windows machine you can just run the commands
directly on the server machine.

## Continue Installing Kuzzle [SERVER]

Good to see you made it this far. You should be on the server now and the installation
scripts is now on the server.

Lets continue the installation (assuming install directory is kuzzle);

    cd kuzzle/setup
    ./install.sh

Now follow the prompts carefully. And the installation should finish.

## Optional: Install reverse proxy with encryption

This script allows you to install a reverse proxy

## Monitoring Commands

Check elasticsearch logs and services:

    journalctl systemctl -l -u elasticsearch
    sudo systemctl status redis

Check redis status:

    sudo systemctl status redis


## Adjusting firewall

Check status:

    ufw status verbose

Some other obvious commands:

    ufw default deny incoming
    ufw default allow outgoing
    ufw allow 7513
    ufw enable

### Managing the Nginx Process

To stop your web server, type:

    sudo systemctl stop nginx

To start the web server when it is stopped, type:

    sudo systemctl start nginx

To stop and then start the service again, type:

    sudo systemctl restart nginx

If you are simply making configuration changes, Nginx can often reload without dropping connections. To do this, type:

    sudo systemctl reload nginx

By default, Nginx is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, you can disable this behavior by typing:

    sudo systemctl disable nginx

To re-enable the service to start up at boot, you can type:

    sudo systemctl enable nginx

Also some tests you can run to test it

    ip addr show eth0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'
